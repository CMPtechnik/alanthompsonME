      <h1>Car Air Conditioning Service & Maintenance</h1>
      <p>
        Air conditioning isn’t just for hot summer days—it’s essential for defogging and demisting windows during colder months. Ensuring your system works efficiently all year round is vital for your comfort and safety. At Alan Thompson Motor Engineers, we recommend regular maintenance and inspection to keep your air conditioning operating at its best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although air conditioning checks are not part of your car’s standard annual service, an independent inspection can be extremely beneficial for vehicles over two years old. Many owners find that a refrigerant recharge (also known as a re-gas) is necessary to maintain peak performance.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Look Out For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loss of Cooling Efficiency:</strong> A noticeable decrease in cooling performance is a key indicator that service may be needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual Odours:</strong> Strange or musty smells can signal bacterial buildup or potential system issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Blowing Warm Air:</strong> If your system starts blowing warm instead of cold air, it might be undercharged or malfunctioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Engine Load:</strong> An inefficient AC can cause your engine to work harder, leading to higher fuel consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent Musty Smell:</strong> Lingering musty odours when the system has been idle may require an anti-bacterial cleaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular Usage:</strong> Run your air conditioning for at least 20 minutes, twice a week—even in winter—to keep the system in optimal condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Treatment:</strong> Apply an anti-bacterial and anti-odour treatment each year to help prevent unpleasant smells and improve in-car air quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the Condenser Clean:</strong> Ensure the condenser, typically located in front of the radiator, is free from debris such as leaves or insects so it can efficiently disperse heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Servicing:</strong> Have your air conditioning system inspected by a specialist every two years. This service should include leak testing, filter replacement, and topping up the refrigerant in line with manufacturer guidelines.</li>
      </ul>

        Our qualified technicians at Alan Thompson Motor Engineers are dedicated to keeping your car’s air conditioning system in peak condition. Regular maintenance not only enhances comfort but also prolongs the system’s lifespan, ensuring you drive in comfort all year round.
