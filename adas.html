      <h2>Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) Calibration</h2>
      <p>
        At Alan Thompson Motor Engineers, we provide expert ADAS calibration to ensure your vehicle’s state-of-the-art safety features work perfectly. Our advanced calibration process aligns your vehicle's cameras and sensors to the manufacturer’s standards, guaranteeing optimal performance and peace of mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is ADAS Calibration Essential?</h3>
      <p>
        Modern vehicles come equipped with innovative safety features such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB), lane departure warnings, and adaptive lighting. For these systems to function reliably, precise calibration is critical. Poor calibration can lead to decreased system performance and increased safety risks.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Calibration Process</h3>
      <p>
        Our highly skilled technicians follow a rigorous process, which includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Static Calibration:</strong> Performed in our specialized calibration centre using levelled flooring and state-of-the-art equipment to ensure pinpoint accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Calibration:</strong> Includes on-road testing to refine sensor alignment under real driving conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We advise that ADAS calibration be performed after significant vehicle repairs, such as windshield replacements, bumper fixes, or after any front-end collision, to maintain the integrity of your vehicle’s safety systems.
      </p>
